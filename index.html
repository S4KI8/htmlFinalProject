              <h3>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</h3>
              <p>
                The greatest film ever made began with the meeting of two
                brilliant minds: Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur C
                Clarke. ‘I understand he’s a nut who lives in a tree in India
                somewhere,’ noted Kubrick when Clarke’s name came up – along
                with those of Isaac Asimov, Robert A Heinlein and Ray Bradbury –
                as a possible writer for his planned sci-fi epic. Clarke was
                actually living in Ceylon (not in India, or a tree), but the
                pair met, hit it off, and forged a story of technological
                progress and disaster (hello, HAL) that’s steeped in humanity,
                in all its brilliance, weakness, courage and mad ambition. An
                audience of stoners, wowed by its eye-candy Star Gate sequence
                and pioneering visuals, adopted it as a pet movie. Were it not
                for them, 2001 might have faded into obscurity, but it’s hard to
                imagine it would have stayed there. Kubrick’s frighteningly
                clinical vision of the future – AI and all – still feels
                prophetic, more than 50 years on.—Phil de Semlyen

              <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
              <p>
                From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime
                dynasties that came after The Godfather are descendants of the
                Corleones: Francis Ford Coppola’s magnum opus is the ultimate
                patriarch of the Mafia genre. A monumental opening line (“I
                believe in America”) sets the operatic Mario Puzo adaptation in
                motion, before Coppola’s epic morphs into a chilling dismantling
                of the American dream. The corruption-soaked story follows a
                powerful immigrant family grappling with the paradoxical values
                of reign and religion; those moral contradictions are
                crystallized in a legendary baptism sequence, superbly edited in
                parallel to the murdering of four rivaling dons. With countless
                iconic details—a horse’s severed head, Marlon Brando’s wheezy
                voice, Nino Rota’s catchy waltz—The Godfather’s authority lives
                on.—Tomris Laffly

              <h3>Citizen Kane (1941)</h3>
              <p>
                Back in the headlines thanks to David Fincher’s brilliantly
                acerbic making-of drama Mank, Citizen Kane always finds a way to
                renew itself for a new generation of film lovers. For newbies,
                the journey of its bulldozer of a protagonist – played with
                inexhaustible force by actor-director-wunderkind Orson Welles –
                from unloved child to thrusting entrepreneur to press baron to
                populist feels entirely au courant (in unconnected news, Donald
                Trump came out as a superfan). You can bathe in the film’s
                groundbreaking techniques, like Gregg Toland’s deep-focus
                photography, or the limitless self-confidence of its staging and
                its investigation of American capitalism. But it’s also just a
                damn good story that you definitely don’t need to be a hardened
                cineaste to enjoy.—Phil de Semlyen
